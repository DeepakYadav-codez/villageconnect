# 🌾 VillageConnect – Day 16 (Internship Project)

This is the initial setup for the **VillageConnect** web application as part of my Python Developer Internship.

The goal of this project is to help villagers connect with essential services like electricity, healthcare, water supply, etc. using a simple web platform.
